The patient went to \nCity Hospital Accident and Emergency where they were examined. X-rays were taken and \nthe doctor diagnosed a whiplash injury and lower back strain.\n\nThe patient has been attending physiotherapy sessions - they've completed ten sessions \nso far. They've also been taking painkillers regularly for the discomfort. The neck \nstiffness has improved significantly, and their range of motion in the cervical and \nlumbar spine is nearly back to normal.\n\nThe physiotherapist said the patient is making good progress and expects them to make \na full recovery within six months. There should be no long-term damage from the soft \ntissue injuries sustained in the accident.\n",
